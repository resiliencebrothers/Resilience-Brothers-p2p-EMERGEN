# Resilience Brothers — P2P Trading Platform

<!--
  TODO · When you first push this repo to GitHub, replace `<ORG>/<REPO>` in
  the CI badge below with your real slug (e.g. `resilience-brothers/p2p-exchange-hub`).
  It's a single find-and-replace — the badge will start auto-updating with
  each push.

Global P2P trading platform for digital assets, fiat currency and physical goods.
Connects businesses and clients across LatAm with dynamic commissions, KYC/AML,
granular RBAC, on-chain crypto verification and a full compliance audit trail.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Full backend suite (~8-9 min, 935 tests)
make test-all

# Critical regression subset (~1 min, 91 tests) — run before pushing
make test-critical

# Ultra-fast drift check (~15s, 6 tests) — used in pre-commit
make smoke

# Wire up the pre-commit hook (one-time per clone)
make install-hooks
```

## Pre-commit Hook

The `.githooks/pre-commit` script runs automatically on every commit and:

1. **Scans for secrets** — blocks BIP39 mnemonics, private keys, xpubs, AWS/Google
   keys, JWTs and `.env` files from being committed.
2. **Warns on large files** — surfaces staged files >1 MB that likely don't
   belong in Git.
3. **Runs the critical regression suite** — 91 tests, ~1 min, only when
   `backend/*.py` files are staged. Catches:
   - RBAC-lite permission drift (iter55.16)
   - Audit log integrity (iter55.16b)
   - Company funds adjustments (iter55.15)
   - Notification lifecycle (iter55.18)
   - Crypto network mismatch (iter55.19c / 19h)
   - Session TTL cap (iter55.37)
   - TOTP step-up gates (iter13/14)

### Bypass options

| Situation | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Emergency hotfix, skip everything | `git commit --no-verify` |
| Skip only the test suite (keep secret-scan) | `SKIP_CRITICAL_TESTS=1 git commit` |
| Frontend-only or docs-only changes | Hook auto-skips tests |

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` mirrors the pre-commit gate
at the remote level so PRs from clones without the hook still get caught:

| Trigger | What runs | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Push / PR to main-master-develop** | `mypy` + `make test-critical` (91 tests) + ESLint | ~2-3 min |
| **Nightly cron (03:00 UTC)** | Same jobs but `make test-all` (935 tests) | ~10-12 min |
| **Manual dispatch** (Actions tab) | Same as push | ~2-3 min |

The nightly full-suite catches slow-drift regressions that the fast critical
subset can miss (e.g. iter55.36b's motor event-loop contamination — invisible
in isolation, only surfaces under the full suite load).

Test users are seeded idempotently by `backend/scripts/seed_test_users.py`
before the FastAPI backend starts, using placeholder secrets set in the
workflow's `env:` block (no real credentials in CI).

## Branch Protection Rule (one-time setup on GitHub)

Once the CI workflow has run at least once (so GitHub knows about the checks),
lock down `main` so PRs cannot merge with a broken build — even if someone
tries `git commit --no-verify` locally:

1. **Repo → Settings → Branches → Add branch ruleset** (or "Add classic branch
   protection rule" if you prefer the older UI).
2. **Branch name pattern**: `main` (add `master` and `develop` too if you use them).
3. Enable these boxes:

   | Setting | Value | Why |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Require a pull request before merging | ✅ | Blocks direct pushes to `main` |
   | Require approvals | `1` (or more) | Second-pair-of-eyes on every change |
   | Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed | ✅ | Reviewers re-approve after fixes |
   | Require status checks to pass before merging | ✅ | The core gate |
   | Require branches to be up to date before merging | ✅ | No merge on stale main |
   | Status checks that are required | `Backend · pytest`, `Backend · mypy`, `Frontend · ESLint` | The 3 job names from `ci.yml` |
   | Require conversation resolution before merging | ✅ | No lingering review comments |
   | Require signed commits | ✅ *(optional)* | Extra provenance guarantee |
   | Do not allow bypassing the above settings | ✅ | Applies rules even to admins |
   | Restrict who can push to matching branches | ✅ + `nobody` | Force everything through PRs |

4. **Save changes**.

From this point forward:
- `git push origin main` from any clone → **rejected** ("protected branch").
- Merge button on a PR → **greyed out** until the 3 status checks are green.
- `git commit --no-verify` still works locally, but the CI on the remote will
  still block the merge — the fast-path safety net is now redundant with a
  hard remote gate, exactly what we want.

If the CI ever needs a "hotfix bypass" (production down, hours of test flake),
temporarily uncheck **"Do not allow bypassing"** so an admin can merge → then
re-check it immediately after. All bypasses show up in the audit log.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI + Motor (MongoDB async) at `/backend/server.py`. All
  routes prefixed with `/api`.
- **Frontend**: React 19 + React Router + Tailwind + Shadcn UI at `/frontend/src`.
- **Auth**: Custom Google OAuth 2.0 (`/api/auth/google/login`) + email/password
  fallback. First registered user auto-promoted to admin.
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for proof uploads (base64 → object storage on the
  fly, iter35).
- **Security**: TOTP 2FA on all financial actions, IP blocklist middleware,
  rate limits (slowapi), CORS allowlist, security headers (HSTS/CSP), automated
  anomaly scan every 5 min, monthly audit report auto-emailed to ops (iter55.21).

| **Staff Member** | — | — | — | Granular per-permission RBAC (13 codes) |
| **Admin** | — | — | — | Full access + treasury adjustments |
